System functions implements control of entities introduced as separate folders in the current directory. Let’s dive through some types of relation examples that can happen between entities.</p><p><b>Imperium:</b> In this layout, one big entity is surrounded by other smaller entities introduced as her enemies. Also the biggest entity by its rating value easily suppress its enemies and is harder to be destroyed. Yet the smaller entities keep on resisting the dominance of the biggest entity while they are easily be destroyed by the empire while fighting.</p><p><b>Conquest:</b> Two various entities are being united into a new entity, with their ratings being summed up and the results saved to a new entity. If any of these entities have no rating or it’s zero or negative number, it’s converted to 1 during the merge operation.</p><p><b>Division:</b> One big entity is being divided into any number of smaller entities, with the rating of the bigger entity is divided into the number of resulting entities. The resulting division rating value is rounded to a close integer.</p><p><b>Contra:</b> When two factions, Left and Right are fighting each other (must be of different entity modes), the Right one usually have an advantage like more powerful weapons, more deadly tanks and explosives. The Left faction is the weakest one because their weapons and battle parameters are the worst. The Center faction can only fight its own faction, but can collaborate with the entities of either Left or Right faction. Each faction has its own behaviorial pattern. The Left are usually complain, the Right are the most aggressive, and the Center are indifferent and feel like lone wolves rather than parts of their faction.</p>
