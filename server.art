Web Instance Basics=||=Any server document root directory on the web server is called instance. Any instance can include subfolders of any kind, depending on what files they contain. Rating and mode files make any directory inside the instance a profile, get.php script make it a system. Any directory inside the instance or path inside it can be both or none of them. Any profile or system in the web server is portable, it means that any of them can be easily moved to another web server, be divided into separate parts or merged into a new one, be created with init command and be wiped out with kill command. Any directory containing profile, system or both is called entity.<br>Unlike join and leave commands, merge and divide commands work only with directories, changing their ratings and modes, and operate at one level of server filesystem.
