Mechanica=||=Each profile/entity mode accepts one of three values that define its own faction, i.e. modus operandi. These values are -1 for Left, 0 for Center/Moderate and 1 for Right. Let's talk about each of them.<br>The two main traits of the <b>Left</b> is solidarity and inclusivity. It means that whatever profile it will be, it will require respect to itself and will whine everytime someone else try to suppress it. Solidarity means need for agreement with those profiles no matter what they represent. Inclusivity means that these profiles are so diverse they have different styles and manners. No matter how much you like them or not, you should never criticize them. They are rarely black and white as they tend to be as much different and nonconformist as possible.<br>And yet, if you still don't like their way, you would probably be interested in the <b>Right</b>. Rather than following any trend, they stand at their own and will not allow anyone to change their ways. Their style can be impeccable enough for you to fall in love with them. But choosing perfection over diversity, you will find yourself to have less choice and less freedom in their circle, but at least you will be very much satisfied with their ways so you probably will never want to leave them for something else. Instead of myriads of choices, flavors and traits you will see the only one for which you will agree in the most cases, no matter how much it fits your personality.<br>Much more interesting group is <b>Center</b>, which have some features of both Left and Right, and still belonging to none of these groups. To say it simple, they are neutral which means they are not supporting any of them. Unlike both Left and Right, the representatives of Center are lone wolves than parts of a team, so they can fight each other and easily dissent if they want. Each of them can use any style it wants because there is no solidarity or conformity between them.
