Models|[1]|<p>Every web instance has its own set of operation models. They represent the branches of activities in which the apps installed on an instance work. There are packages that represent and implement the functionality of models, using the same name as the name of its respective model. For example, file is a model for web system, there is a package for it called file. This package comes with basic file operations like move, copy and delete for web systems. In order for it to use in various web apps from separate packages independently from them, this package does not include any GUI app. Instead, there are separate packages that use the components from this package, like the files package which contains GUI apps like file manager and uploader. Entity is also a model used to control subdirectories in web server instance, their data, settings and content.</p>
