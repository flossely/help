Mechanics=||=<p>Each profile/entity mode accepts one of three values that define its own faction, i.e. modus operandi. These values are -1 for Left, 0 for Center/Moderate and 1 for Right. Let's talk about each of them.</p><p>The two main traits of the <b>Left</b> is solidarity and inclusivity. It means that whatever profile it will be, it will require respect to itself and will whine everytime someone else try to suppress it. Solidarity means need for agreement with those profiles no matter what they represent. Inclusivity means that these profiles are so diverse they have different styles and manners. No matter how much you like them or not, you should never criticize them. They are rarely black and white as they tend to be as much different and nonconformist as possible.<br>And yet, if you still don't like their rather screwed ways of doing things, you would probably get along with the <b>Right</b>. Rather than following any trend, they stand at their own and will not allow anyone to change their ways. Their style can be impeccable enough for you to fall in love with them. But choosing perfection over diversity, you will find yourself to have less choice and less freedom in their circle, but at least you will be very much satisfied with their ways so you probably will never want to leave them for something else. Instead of myriads of choices, flavors and traits you will see the only one for which you will agree in the most cases, no matter how much it fits your personality.<br>Much more interesting group is <b>Center</b>, which have some features of both Left and Right, and still belonging to none of these groups. To say it simple, they are neutral which means they are not supporting any of them. Unlike both Left and Right, the representatives of Center are rather lone wolves than parts of a team, so they can fight each other and easily dissent if they want. Each of them can use any style it wants because there is no solidarity or conformity between them.</p><p>When we talk about those factions, their behavioral pattern types cannot be more obvious. Typical representative of the Left is a supporter of fandom. Like the whole Left group is diverse, fandom are very different to the point of fighting each other just because their qualities and interests are very much different. They most likely stand up for their identities and autochtonous groups while being overly defensive to the point of bashing anyone who criticize whom they support. Contrary to that, the representatives of Right are not some delusional fans but rather their haters and more freedom-loving, critical-thinking antipodes who consider themselves to be representatives of a master race, or people of a superior breeding. They can get away with anything especially when it comes to defending their values and ideals, while they are the most impeccable to the point that they are never attacked or criticized. Quite the opposite, it's representatives of Right who constantly attack and terrorize the representatives of the Left for what ways they have chosen for themselves. Being critical, harsh, judgmental and aggressive is a typical trait of the Right.<br>Based on that, let we now see their another respective attitude models. Left are always irritated, restless, frenzied and hysterical in their ways to defend themselves from the persecution which usually comes from the Right. At the same time, due to their power, majority and privileged status, Right feel very much comfortable in their own skin, always know what they want for life and never show any even slightest signs of weakness.</p>
