Introduction|[1]|<p>Welcome to the web system comprehensive guide for the users and system administrators. Download and install any web application you want, test your favorite browser games, manage the content on a server, test some functions of web applications, learn to perform basic tasks and manage packages that you can install from Git repositories, deploy a web server and install Get Package Manager to build your functioning web system.</p><p>With the Get Package Manager, you can download and install any package to your web server current directory from any online/public Git repository. You can update existing packages, replace them with another ones or remove them from the current directory in a web server opened in your browser that contains get.php file.</p><p>A web system working on web server is a complex of web applications that make it work like any typical operation system, with user and content managing functions implemented. A directory with web system must contain a package manager app or script that can download packages and manage installed third-party applications.</p><p>The latest version of a web system working with Get Package Manager is amorphous and bare bones since you decide how your web system and instance would look like, download any third-party content from online Git repository and extend the functionality of your website, much like what you would usually do on your Linux system. It should include Get Package Manager as necessary component. Without it, you can still use web apps but you will be unable to reinstall them and download any content from online Git repositories.</p><p>Like in the case of Linux systems, every package you download from online Git repository has its own symbolic ID which is also the package's basename. To make operations with packages you need to know their precise IDs.</p>
