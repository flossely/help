Operations=||=<p>Any server document root directory on the web server is called instance. Any instance can include subfolders of any kind, depending on what files they contain. Rating and mode files make any directory inside the instance a profile, get.php script make it a system. Any directory inside the instance or path inside it can be both or none of them. Any profile or system in the web server is portable, it means that any of them can be easily moved to another web server, be divided into separate parts or merged into a new one, be created with init command and be wiped out with kill command. Any directory containing profile, system or both is called entity.<br>Unlike join and leave commands, merge and divide commands work only with directories, changing their ratings and modes, and operate at one level of server filesystem. Merging directories result in surplus in the resulting entity rating and median parameter of their modes. Source directories are being deleted after merge. Dividing the entity into any number of resulting entities will have their ratings calculated as the rating of source entity divided into the number of resulting entities. The result is being rounded into an integer number. In contrast, join and leave commands do not destroy source entities, don't change their data and can operate at many levels of file system.<br>Every app inside the current directory work with files which relative path starts with the current directory. Files managers accept any directory inside the current one as its request parameter. This parameter is used in glob function to display files inside the directory entered in this parameter, limited only by query parameter. In many other cases, the app executes glob function within the current directory.</p>
