Package Manager=||=<p>Get package manager is a universal tool to manage installed packages per one directory launched on web browser where your get.php is located. Get package manager works in 3 modes: Install/Update (i), Reinstall/Replace (r) and Deinstall/Remove (d). Get package request consist of the following parameters: mode, existing package, foreign package, user/owner of foreign package. It can also include optional parameter such as host URL of Git repository provider. The last two parameters accept the target repo and its user from GitHub or other online Git repository website respectively. It's an easy and versatile way of managing packages and installing them from online repositories, considering that it's being used in plain Web environment, so you won't ever need to use additional apps or clients in your end-user operating system to run it.</p><p>The default Git repository provider for your system is GitHub. In the case your current system directory does not have get.cfg file or it's empty, the repository provider will be used by default is GitHub. However, you can execute Get package manager command with host parameter of online Git repository website URL converted to its hexadecimal code. Please keep in mind that changing your default Git repository provider for your system can make the most content you used to download and install to your system unavailable for a time since the most of them are stored in GitHub. If you choose another provider, please make sure to know what content is stored there and why do you choose it over GitHub.</p><p>Since the version of Get Package Manager 3.3, new features and parameters added to the original Get PHP script. There are no such a thing like default Git host URL anymore, the host parameter sets as a pure hexadecimal cipher of any source Git host URL. For example, GitHub URL encodes as 68747470733a2f2f6769746875622e636f6d in host parameter. Since this version, you can set host parameter as empty, so it will download packages from GitHub. Another one big difference from older versions of Get package manager is a branch parameter that allows user to download/clone Git repository from any branch other than which is set by default for chosen repository. Leave this parameter blank to download repository from its default branch.</p><p>There is a moment you should well pay attention to. You cannot have 2 or more packages of different branches from the same Git repository. Get Install (i) function, when attempting to download another branch of the package existing in the current web working directory, will simply overwrite files from an existing package with the new ones from another branch. That's why multiple branches of Git repository is being mainly used in packaging and supplying web systems and platforms. In other cases, the replace (r) function is used, unless you're downloading a new package.</p>
